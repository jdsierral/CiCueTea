# 🍵 CiCueTea

**CiCueTea** is a high-performance, real-time Constant-Q Transform engine based on **nonstationary Gabor frames**. Built for spectral signal processing. It is designed to be invertibile and low-latency operation, it powers the core of the [CiCueProc](www.JuanSaudio.com/audio-plugins) plugin suite.

> 🎧 “Brew your spectrum.”™

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Real-time performance**: Suitable for plugin use, interactive DSP, and low-latency environments.
- ♻ **Invertibile** (within numerical tolerance): Enables seamless reconstruction after transformation.
- 🔍 **High frequency resolution** at low frequencies, **high time resolution** at high frequencies.
- 🧠 **Based on Nonstationary Gabor Frames (NSGF)**: Sample-exact theoretical foundation.
- 🛠️ Modular design: Drop into any C++ project.
- ✌️ **Two different versions**: A dense version that has the same sample-rate at every band, and a sparse version that has a decimated sample-rate per band.
- 👀 **Multiple FFT Backends**: vDSP (Default), MKL, FFTW and PFFT backends supported

## 🔧 Installation

### CMake (recommended)

```cmake
# Top-level CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory(Libs/CiCueTea)

target_link_libraries(MyPlugin PRIVATE CiCueTea)
target_include_directories(MyPlugin PRIVATE Libs/CiCueTea/include)
```

Or link it as a Git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/CiCueTea Libs/CiCueTea
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 🧪 Example Usage


```cpp
#include <Eigen/Core>
#include <CQT.hpp>

long N = 1<<16;
double fs = 48000;
double fMin = 100;
double fMax = 10000;
double fRef = 440;
jsa::NsgfCqtDense cqt(fs, nSamps, frac, fMin, fMax, fRef);

Eigen::ArrayXd x(cqt.getNumSamples());
Eigen::ArrayXd y(cqt.getNumSamples());
Eigen::ArrayXXcd Xcq(cqt.getNumSamples(), cqt.getNumBands());

// Forward transform
cqt.forward(x, Xcq);

// Inverse transform
cqt.inverse(Xcq, y);
```
 or
 ```cpp
#include <Eigen/Core>
#include <CQT.hpp>

long N = 1<<16;
double fs = 48000;
double fMin = 100;
double fMax = 10000;
double fRef = 440;
jsa::NsgfCqtSparse cqt(fs, nSamps, frac, fMin, fMax, fRef);

Eigen::ArrayXd x(cqt.getNumSamples());
Eigen::ArrayXd y(cqt.getNumSamples());
auto Xcq = cqt.getCoefs();

// Forward transform
cqt.forward(x, Xcq);

// Inverse transform
cqt.inverse(Xcq, y);
```

| Parameter       | Description                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fs`            | Sample Rate since in the CQT it is highly connected                  |
| `nSamples`      | Number of Samples to transform                                       |
| `frac`          | This is the reciprocal of points per octave allowing                 | 
|                 | fractional values                                                    |
| `minFrequency`  | Start of frequency range (e.g., 100 Hz as going to low               |
|                 | increases latency)                                                   |
| `maxFrequency`  | Upper limit of transform (Limits the range with Constant-Q property) |

> CiCueTea uses **Gaussian windows designed in log-frequency** to obtain perfect
> pitch symmetry.

## 🧠 What Makes It Special?

Most CQT implementations either:

- Are not invertible,
- Are not usable in real time,
- Are not designed for true symmetric log-frequency shaped pass-bands

**CiCueTea** is designed to achieve **all three**:

- Real-time forward/inverse streaming
- Numerically accurate reconstruction
- High resolution in perceptually-relevant bands
