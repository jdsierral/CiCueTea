# 🍵 CiCueTea

**CiCueTea** is a high-performance, real-time Constant-Q Transform engine based on **nonstationary Gabor frames**. Built for spectral signal processing with near-perfect invertibility and low-latency operation, it powers the core of the [CiCue](https://github.com/your-org) plugin suite.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Real-time performance**: Suitable for plugin use, interactive DSP, and low-latency environments.
- 🔁 **Perfect invertibility** (within numerical tolerance): Enables seamless reconstruction after transformation.
- 🔍 **High frequency resolution** at low frequencies, **high time resolution** at high frequencies.
- 🧠 **Based on Nonstationary Gabor Frames (NSGF)**: Sample-exact theoretical foundation.
- 🛠️ Modular design: Drop into any C++ project or integrate as a JUCE module.

## 🔧 Installation

### CMake (recommended)

```cmake
# Top-level CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory(Libs/CiCueTea)

target_link_libraries(MyPlugin PRIVATE CiCueTea)
target_include_directories(MyPlugin PRIVATE Libs/CiCueTea/include)

Or link it as a Git submodule:

git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/CiCueTea Libs/CiCueTea
git submodule update --init --recursive

🧪 Example Usage

#include <cicuetea/CQT.h>

jsa::tea::CQT cqt;
cqt.prepare(sampleRate, fftSize, hopSize);

// Forward transform
auto spectrum = cqt.forward(inputBlock);

// Inverse transform
auto reconstructed = cqt.inverse(spectrum);


📐 Parameters & Design Notes

binsPerOctave
Controls resolution — typically 24 or 36
minFreq
Start of frequency range (e.g., 30 Hz)
maxFreq
Upper limit of transform
gamma
Time/frequency scaling behavior
overlap
How much overlap exists in analysis windows
windowType
Type of analysis window (Gaussian preferred)

CiCueTea uses nonzero Gaussian windows for excellent frequency localization and smooth invertibility.

🧠 What Makes It Special?

Most CQT implementations either:
	•	Are not invertible,
	•	Are not usable in real time,
	•	Or compromise on time/frequency resolution.

CiCueTea is designed to achieve all three:
	•	Real-time forward/inverse streaming
	•	Almost perfect numerical reconstruction
	•	High resolution in perceptually-relevant bands

📦 Used in
	•	🎛️ CiCuePitchScrambler
	•	🎚️ CiCueEQ
	•	🔊 CiCueSpectrum
